# Empirical Mode Decomposition
**Data-driven Time-Scale Decomposition Method for Nonlinear and Nonstationary Signals**

---

## What is EMD?

- Adaptive signal decomposition technique introduced by Huang et al. (1998)
- Decomposes complex signals into simple oscillatory components
- No predefined basis functions required
- Works directly with the signal's intrinsic characteristics

---

## Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)

- Building blocks of EMD decomposition
- Each IMF represents a specific time scale
- Properties:
    - Number of extrema and zero-crossings differ by at most one
    - Local mean is zero at any point
- Signal = Sum of IMFs + Residual

## Applications

- **Biomedical**: EEG/ECG analysis, neural signal processing
- **Geophysics**: Seismic data analysis, climate studies
- **Engineering**: Vibration analysis, fault detection
- **Finance**: Stock market trend analysis
- **Oceanography**: Wave analysis
