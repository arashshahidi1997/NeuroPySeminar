Fourier transforms are a tool used in a whole bunch of different things. This is an explanation of what a Fourier transform does, and some different ways it can be useful. And how you can make pretty things with it, like this thing:

<canvas id="self-draw" class="sketch" width=500 height=500></canvas>

I'm going to explain how that animation works, and along the way explain Fourier transforms!

By the end you should have a good idea about
- What a Fourier transform does
- Some practical uses of Fourier transforms
- Some pointless but cool uses of Fourier transforms

We're going to leave the mathematics and equations out of it for now. There's a bunch of interesting maths behind it, but it's better to start with what it actually does, and why you'd want to use it first. If you want to know more about the how, there's some further reading suggestions below!
