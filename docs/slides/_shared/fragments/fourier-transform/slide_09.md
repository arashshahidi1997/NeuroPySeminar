To learn more, some really good resources you can check out are:

[An Interactive Guide To The Fourier Transform](https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/)
A great article that digs more into the mathematics of what happens.

[But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)
A great Youtube video by 3Blue1Brown, also explaining the maths of Fourier transforms from an audio perspective.

[A Tale of Math & Art: Creating the Fourier Series Harmonic Circles Visualization](https://alex.miller.im/posts/fourier-series-spinning-circles-visualization/)
Another article explaining how you can use epicycles to draw a path, explained from a linear algebra perspective.

[Fourier transform (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform)
And of course, the Wikipedia article is pretty good too.
