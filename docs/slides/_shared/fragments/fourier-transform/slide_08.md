## Questions for the curious

I skipped most of the math stuff here, but if you're interested in the underlying principles of how it works, here are some questions you can use to guide your research:

- How do you mathematically represent a Fourier transform?
- What's the difference between a continuous time Fourier transform and a discrete time Fourier transform?
- How do you computationally do a Fourier transform?
- How do you do a Fourier transform of a whole song? (Rather than just a single note.)
