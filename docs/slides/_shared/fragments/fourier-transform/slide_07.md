## Conclusion

So let's recap:

- Fourier transforms are things that let us take something and split it up into its frequencies.
- The frequencies tell us about some fundamental properties of the data we have
- And can compress data by only storing the important frequencies
- And we can also use them to make cool looking animations with a bunch of circles

This is just scratching the surface into some applications. The Fourier transform is an extremely powerful tool, because splitting things up into frequencies is so fundamental. They're used in a lot of fields, including circuit design, mobile phone signals, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and quantum physics!
