**Content**:
Implementing new data analysis methods used in recent publications in python, with the aim of reproducing and exploring results from the papers, with a side look at the theoretical and algorithmic basis of the methods relying on analysis text books.

**Learning outcome**:
Students obtain hands on experience with implementation of recent data analysis methods and reproduce and explore data from published papers, preparing them for using the methods and potentially adapting them to their own research needs. The seminar will also provide students with knowledge on how to critically evaluate 


**Course Description**:

**Content**: This seminar introduces recent data analysis methods highlighted in current research papers. Using Python, participants will actively implement these techniques, gaining firsthand experience. The foundational theories behind these methods will be discussed, referencing established analytical texts. We'll particularly focus on analysis methods regarding time series data, dimensionality reduction, and dynamical systems.

**Learning Outcomes**:

1. Grasp and apply contemporary data analysis methods from recent research.
2. Efficiently utilize Python to implement and validate these techniques.
3. Comprehend the basic theoretical principles underpinning these methods.
4. Acquire the capability to assess and modify these techniques for specific research objectives.
