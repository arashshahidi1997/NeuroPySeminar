This seminar introduces recent data analysis methods highlighted in current research papers. Using Python, participants will  implement these techniques and apply to data, either publicly available or data from their own projects. We'll particularly focus on analysis methods regarding ***time series data, dimensionality reduction, and dynamical systems***. The foundational theories behind these methods will be discussed, referencing established analytical texts.
