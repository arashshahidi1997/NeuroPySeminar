## 🌱 Minimal Prerequisites for Learning the Methods

1. **Python Basics** 🐍
    
    - Write simple scripts.
        
    - Use libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.
        
2. **Linear Algebra (lightweight)** ➕
    
    - Vectors and matrices.
        
    - Matrix multiplication, eigenvalues/eigenvectors.
        
3. **Probability & Statistics (essentials)** 🎲
    
    - Mean, variance, correlation.
        
    - Gaussian (normal) distribution.
        
4. **Signal Processing & Fourier Basics** 🎶
    
    - What is frequency?
        
    - Fourier transform for breaking signals into components.
        
5. **Machine Learning Concepts (intro level)** 🤖
    
    - What “dimensionality reduction” means (compressing data).
        
    - What “clustering” means (grouping similar things).

✨ That’s enough to start exploring PCA, ICA, EMD, UMAP, and the rest. You don’t need to be an expert — just some **curiosity and willingness to learn** will take you a long way.
