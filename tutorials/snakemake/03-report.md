You can generate a report of your Snakemake workflow using the `snakemake --report` command. This report compiles information about the executed rules, their inputs and outputs, execution times, and any figures generated during the workflow.

```bash
snakemake --report report.html
```

to see this in your browser, serve your current directory using Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

VSCode users can use the "Live Server" extension to serve the files.

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/report.html` to view the report.

To include a figure generated by a rule in the report html, modify the `plot_with_python` rule as follows:

```python
rule plot_with_python:
    input:
        "derivatives/hilbert/freq-{freq}_r-{r}_amplitude.npy"
    output:
        report(
            "figures/python-plot/freq-{freq}_r-{r}_amplitude.png",
            category="Plot",
            labels={"plot": "amplitude"},
        )
    script:
        "../scripts/plot.py"
```
