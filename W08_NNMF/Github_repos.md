We also implemented CNMF-E as part of the Python package CaImAn (Giovannucci et al., 2017b), a computational analysis toolbox for large-scale calcium imaging and behavioral data (https://github.com/simonsfoundation/CaImAn [Giovannucci et al., 2017a]). The scripts for generating all figures and the experimental data in this paper can be accessed from https://github.com/zhoupc/eLife_submission (Zhou, 2017b).
